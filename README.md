Are Hong Kong's Baby Care Rooms Adequate? A missing corner of the city

GUO Yuju, CAI Runlin, Hu Qiuyue, Tang Biwei

When you cannot find the elevator with your heavy luggage, when you struggle to find the route with heavy things, do you feel the inconvenience that the lack of infrastructure construction brings to your life? This inconvenience may be commonplace for parents who are out and about with their babies. Parents usually need to cope with both the baby and the heavy package, and it is a struggle to push the door open by themselves under such circumstances, not to mention the process of finding the way, comforting, and breastfeeding with the baby. So, the imperfection of related public facilities makes it difficult for parents to go out with their babies.

Recently, establishing baby care rooms in public areas has been addressed during broader and broader discussions. The struggle of breastfeeding mothers who are at work has been heard gradually. Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding (Hong Kong)， established in 2014 ，is to advise creating a breastfeeding-friendly environment. In Nov. 2018, the Buildings Department issued Provision of Baby care Rooms and Lactation Rooms in Commercial Buildings to encourage the establishment of baby care rooms and its internal standard facilities in commercial buildings. In 2019, the Legislative Council enacted Promotion of breastfeeding, the Administration stated using multiple measures to promote breastfeeding. 244 government properties with baby care rooms can be found in the official website of Family Health Service, Department of Health, The Government of the Hong Kong SAR by 31 Dec. 2020.

The number of babies born in Hong Kong is more than 50,000 each year, and in 2019, the number of live births in Hong Kong was 52,856. With the increase in the number of babies, the public's demand for nursery rooms also increases. However, the lack of social emphasis on breastfeeding and the inadequacy of baby care rooms in public places still exist in Hong Kong.

The necessity of baby care rooms is not just to facilitate parents to change baby's diapers, it is to establish a complete public space support system for people and families with special needs such as mothers and infants. Its core value lies in the establishment of a good maternity and infant room and its related facilities system to create a public environment that is conducive to breastfeeding at any time when mothers and infants are out, and encourages fathers to participate in parenting behaviors, reflecting the respect of public space for women and concern for babies.

When suckling period mothers cannot find the baby care room, and can not bear the constant crying of the baby in their arms, they sometimes have no choices but to choose to breastfeed in public.  They may feel embarrassed by the complicated sight of others. Wouldn't they rather breastfeed in a more private space？Of course they do, but there is no suitable environment for them to breastfeed. Don't they carthe the sights around them? They care, but they put their baby ahead of their own shame.  The baby care room is a non-profit public service facility for parents to take care of their breastfeeding babies outside. Its relatively private space can avoid the embarrassment of mothers breastfeeding in full view and possible infringements on other people's public space. Therefore, the accessibility of baby care rooms in these public places and the labeling and guidance of their locations are particularly important, which allow people in need to find the places quickly.

As for the accessibility of baby care rooms, the distance between the building where the baby care room is located, and the metro station is one of the aspects that reflect convenience. At 244 government properties with baby care rooms, the distance between a metro station and a government property building with the facilities ranges from 500 meters to more than 5,000 meters, most of which are within 500 meters, while many distances are more than 1,500 meters. Government buildings in the more remote parts of Hong Kong are out of reach of the metro, which is more than 5km from the buildings with baby care room and can only be reached by a self-drive, bus or a long walk.

Large real estate developers tend to have more capital than smaller real estate developers and will be better at building malls. Most shopping malls with the facilities were within 500 meters of the metro station of the 50 malls under 17 well-known or large real estate properties that were screened. Since metro stations can bring huge and stable passenger flow to shopping malls, this seamless mode can not only realize huge commercial value, but also improve the accessibility of baby care rooms.

To measure the accessibility of the baby care room in building, we selected 13 shopping malls along the metro line for field tests, observe whether the actual information matches with the marking on the official website's floor plan, and simulate how long it takes people who need the baby care room to walk from the elevator to the destination after entering the shopping mall. This process includes two steps, that is, entering the shopping mall to the elevator and from the elevator to the baby care room.

In the large shopping malls we visited, the accessibility of baby care room was not as high as we have expected. In practical scenarios, many parents will use baby strollers, which means that taking elevators is the most convenient choice. For large shopping malls, the overall floor area is relatively large, and the lack of guidance on elevators means that mothers will meet difficulties from the first step. In addition, many mall plans show the location of the baby care room, but there is no sign to guide it. Some are even placed in very private locations (outside the exit door), making it a long, agonizing journey for mothers and children in need to find an elevator. In some malls, baby care rooms are marked on the plan and provided with guide sign, but they are not accessible at any time. It is necessary to ask the mall administrator to get the right to use them and unlock the equipment.

A new problem arises when mothers are asked "Why you don't go to the toilet to breastfeed if you can't find a baby care room".

"Do you eat in public restrooms? Even if it is a fancy toilet, the toilet with perfume and soft music, can you eat? Even if you could eat in it, would you let your baby eat in it? Even if you are willing to let your baby have a meal inside, can you hold a baby of 5kg even more than 10kg in breastfeed posture for twenty minutes? Do you know how disgusting and embarrassing it is when your big mom bag drops on the floor and spills its contents all over the floor?" A netizen responded to a question on Zhihu about whether someone breastfeeding on a high-speed train and showing sensitive parts could be brought to the attention of the train staff.

Faced with such a continuous question, we began to think about what facilities a good baby care room should have, both to ensure hygiene and to ensure the convenience of the facilities.

"Today, I went to the mother and baby room for the first time to breastfeed, covered just by a curtain, simple and crude, my baby cried badly. I hurriedly took off three pieces of clothes there to feed him... I realized that my bottom line was here, and I really felt like I wasn't myself at that moment..." a breastfeeding mother posted her experience on social media, with full of frustration and bitterness.

The poor breast-feeding environment oppressed the mother not only physically but also psychologically. The newly born mothers themselves were fragile and full of tension. Facing such an environment, they could not feel respected and even could not identify with themselves.

In November 2018, the Buildings Department released a revised version of "Provision of Baby Care and Breastfeeding Rooms in Commercial Buildings" which sets out seven supporting facilities and space design specifications that should be available in baby care rooms in Hong Kong.

In terms of the environment and facilities, some shopping malls basically meet the requirements of the government proposal document. The baby care room and toilet are separated and have a hygienic and comfortable environment. At the same time, the internal facilities are relatively completed, with comfortable seats, washing equipments and nappy table with raised edges, additional tools such as milk warmers, hot and cold water, and wet wipes, were also provided.

However, there are still many shopping malls where baby care rooms are combined with women's toilets or toilets for the disabled, and the facilities and hygiene conditions are not ideal. The antibodies that newborns receive from their mothers diminish over time, and for babies with insufficient immunity and resistance, bacteria in the toilets may cause infections that can be harmful to their health. At the same time, the diaper table is set up in the women's toilet directly ignoring the possibility of men going out with their babies, and if they do encounter such a need one day, how will they be able to handle it?

From the scene, we can see that some shopping malls only have simple retractable diaper tables installed on the wall. In addition, there is neither a seat for the mother to sit down to breastfeed, nor a small side table can be placed items, and when the diaper table is put down, the space becomes very small, even the stroller cannot be placed, which will cause great inconvenience for mothers who take their babies alone. Without a seat, it is also difficult for a mother to breastfeed for a long time alone.

Diaper tables and hand-washing facilities are the most basic facilities that should be available in baby care rooms. In the process of organizing information, we found that 50 shopping malls where information can be obtained are equipped with these two facilities, which can meet the most basic needs of mothers and babies, but the specific settings have not been implemented in accordance with the requirements of government documents.

The diaper tables in some shopping malls do not meet the recommended standard of "having raised edges" in the government documents, and only about half of the diaper tables in the baby care rooms of the shopping malls have soft cushions. At the same time, some faucets and hand sanitizer equipment do not have automatic sensors. The emphasis on "automatic equipment" in the government document can avoid the risk of bacteria and infection caused by direct contact to a certain extent, and the fact that about half of the baby care rooms of malls do not have these conditions means that there is still a lot of space for improvement in facilities.

Asymmetric information acquisition is also a problem in baby care rooms in shopping malls. Among the 50 shopping malls of 17 large real estate companies, 33 of them have baby care rooms information on their official websites, while only 27 of them have baby care rooms marked on their official floor plans. Although some malls have baby care rooms, they do not provide a convenient way for people in need to search for them, which can lead people to believe that the mall does not have this service. On the other hand, some malls are not marked with the specific location of the baby-sitting room, and the service desk is not in a conspicuous area, so when mothers holding their children in the mall need to use, they have to keep looking in different floor, which is a huge "workload" for parents who go out alone with their babies.

Marking Information of Specific Malls.

As a special use place, the designer should think and design from the perspective of the user. A uniform signage set-up allows users to find the location of the baby care rooms at a glance, rather than having to go through a bunch of various signs to identify it in detail. A clear navigation note allows mothers to find the baby care rooms in the shortest possible time, rather than running back and forth through layers of stores with their babies to find it.

As it becomes more common for men to take their babies out, the baby care rooms are expected to separate the breastfeeding area from the diaper-changing area to give breastfeeding mothers more privacy and respect, and to give men who take their babies out alone a sense of consideration.

Previously, a photo of a mainland female actor breastfeeding in a public place broke out, causing heated discussions among netizens. In fact, this is also the epitome of millions of breastfeeding mothers. They guard the growth of the next generation. When in public, who can guard their privacy and rights?

An ideal baby care room embodies the respect and care for women and children. Through the current visits and observations, although the public is paying more and more attention to the construction of nursery, the baby care room in both commercial places and government properties has not reached a very ideal state, and the construction of baby care room still needs to be strengthened continuously.

The evaluation of a city should not only include an assessment of the hardware, but also some soft cultural components. We should not only pay attention to the GDP of a city or the number of tall buildings built in a year, but care for the citizens themselves is the real place that reflects the temperature of the city. Postpartum women will take their children out, or may return to work after a short period of recuperation, so how to solve the needs of breastfeeding during the period of going out or breastfeeding during work? Government departments and large shopping malls usually have baby care rooms, but CBD in work areas does not seem to provide a care for working women.
